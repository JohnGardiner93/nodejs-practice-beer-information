# Beer Information

## Personal Project #1 for Udemy NodeJS course

This is a project of my own design designed to practice what I have learned up to this point from the following sections in [Jonas Schmedtmann's Node.JS Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/):

- Section 1
- Section 2

## Description:

App that takes JSON of product information and shows it on an overview page. Then, when clicked, a product page is brought up with more-detailed information. Assets from my [Helsgarding Brewing Website Project](https://github.com/JohnGardiner93/helsgardin-website) will be used as a base.

## Requirements:

App will have an overview page and a series of detailed product pages. The overview page will show cards of information indicating what beers are on tap and which are upcoming. When a beer card is clicked, the user will be served a more-detailed product page containing more information about the beer selected.

This site will NOT be responsive. It will be entirely desktop-focused for the time being.
